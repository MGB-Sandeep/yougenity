              <h4>The Team</h4>
              <p>
                Welcome to our team of passionate scientists and developers from Korea and India, who are dedicated to 
                exploring the human genome and applying that knowledge to create novel, innovative projects that benefit society.<br> 
                
                Our team is comprised of experts in various fields including genetics, bioinformatics, computer science, 
                engineering, and design. We work together to combine our skills and knowledge to push the boundaries of 
                whatâ€™s possible with genomic data. We believe that by unlocking the secrets of the human genome, we can 
                empower individuals to not only take control of their health and wellbeing but also express themselves in 
                unique ways in the digital world. Join us, as we express our expertise and creativity with Yougenity.

                Before we launched Yougenity, we developed a unique, personalized digital code based on your genome called the Geni Code. The Geni Code acts as a personal identifier, akin to having your own mobile number or social security number. The code is in the format of a 24 numerical code and with a possible combination of nearly 300 billion, it is virtually impossible to have the same code as somebody else. With Yougenity, when you upload your genome data, your unique Geni Code will be your identification code. You can read more about the Geni Code, in this paper published.With Yougenity, genome data acts as the basis for connecting individuals. We aim to create a community based on commonalities that go beyond superficial similarities such as location, occupation, or looks.
                <br><br><br>

              Our goal is to engage with individuals who possess a genuine curiosity to delve deeper into their personal identities. Yougenity provides valuable insights into your health and wellness through numerous genetic reports provided by companies such as 23andMe, Ancestry.com, or EDGC. In addition, our team is preparing a range of novel ways to express yourself, such as custom art, music, and characters based on your real genome data. And with the rise of popular artificial intelligence (AI) based chatbots such as ChatGPT, you can ask questions related to our service or your own health report by interacting with Geni-bot, our AI genetic counselor, a feature that will be available to our users who have uploaded their genome data. The content market is rapidly expanding and for individuals with deep interest in their genome, we want to continue to provide unique, insightful, and fun content to the most important person in the world. You!
